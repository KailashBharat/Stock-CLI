Idea: Puppeteer with the Finviz screener
The idea is useful for screening for certain types of stock and returning their fundamental data
The stock's information could then be used to make decisions whether to buy or sell a stock.

Todo:
Find a way to let a user create a certain template for selecting stocks
Use the keys.ts file to give the user the filter names and their options
Also let the user specify what kind of options they are specifying, i.e screening for; longterm, shortterm etc...
Then add them to a file
